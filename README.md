# Tina-Times

This is a front-end React app for my news app built on a node.js/express backend server

The Users are able to view articles, view comments on individual article, add a comment on an article,
vote up or down on articles and comments.
There is a topics page on the app which shows the topics of the articles and the corresponding articles on that particular topic. Users are automatically logged in as user 'jessjelly' and they are able to delete their own comments.

You can view this project live at: https://tina-times.netlify.com

THe backend repository of this project can be found at https://github.com/cb15wss/nc-news-be.git

The hosted backend API can be found at: https://xtine-news.herokuapp.com/api/

### Prerequisites:

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[git](https://git-scm.com/)

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cb15wss/nc-news-fe.git
cd ./nc-news-fe

This app is a culmination of the skills and knowledge gained from the first 3 blocks of the Northcoders Coding Bootcamp

#### Future Plans:

-Implement an Add article endpoint on the back end to add more functionality on the front end
-Add a chart using chart.js on the topics page which shows how many articles each topic has inside the database
